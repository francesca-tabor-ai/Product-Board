# ProductSync

**An advanced, AI-orchestrated Product Management Operating System designed to bridge the gap between user signals, strategic prioritization, and technical implementation.**

Inspired by industry leaders like Productboard, ProductSync provides a high-fidelity environment for product teams to quantify value and align their organizations.

## Core Architecture & Capabilities

### Strategic Revenue Intelligence
Beyond simple scoring, ProductSync features a predictive engine that models the impact of your roadmap on core SaaS metrics. It distinguishes between **Growth Revenue** (new acquisition) and **Retention Revenue** (churn reduction), allowing PMs to balance their portfolio based on current company strategy.

### Deep Customer Intelligence
The platform maintains sophisticated "Deep Intel" profiles for customer segments. It tracks firmographics, Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD), and behavioral friction points, providing a 360-degree view of who you are building for and why.

### Dual-Nature Feature Prioritization
ProductSync treats **Platform Primitives** (foundational infra) and **End-User Features** as distinct classes of work. Using a refined RICE scoring model (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort), teams can sort and filter their backlog to ensure they aren't neglecting long-term platform health for short-term UI wins.

### Multi-Resolution Roadmap
Visualise your strategy across a 4-year horizon (1 year historic, 3 years future) with variable resolution—from high-level yearly initiatives down to granular weekly sprints. Switch instantly between a structured Timeline View and a collaborative Kanban Board.

### Feedback Portal & Signal Synthesis
A dedicated community space where users can submit and vote on ideas. The backend uses Gemini AI to cluster these "Trending Ideas" and synthesize them into actionable insights, moving them from "Under Consideration" to "Planned" with data-backed confidence.

### Vibe Code™ Orchestrator
A unique bridge between product and engineering. ProductSync takes your defined features and tech stack constraints to generate high-intent AI prompts (Build Manifests), ready to be consumed by modern coding agents, ensuring implementation perfectly matches the strategic "vibe" and architectural standards.

### Integrated Workspace Management
A centralized hub for Team Administration, Personal Profiles, Enterprise Billing (with local currency overrides), and 3rd-party Integrations (Jira, Slack, Salesforce), providing the governance required for scale.

## Visual Identity

The platform utilizes a **Signature Gradient** aesthetic—a vibrant blend of indigo, violet, and rose—symbolizing the intersection of creative product vision and technical precision. The UI is built for performance with "Premium Shadows," high-contrast typography, and a "Terminal-inspired" dark mode for technical orchestration tasks.
